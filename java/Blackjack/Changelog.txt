=========================
> [B] = Bug fix
> [N] = New feature
* [ ] = Semi-Major update
=========================

=========================
1.5.2
> [N] Dealer isn't allowed to stick when score is under 17.
> [B] When comparing scores, if last player has 21 or current player
      has 21, then compare scores returns true and dosen't try to
      evaluate a winning condition, as there already is one.

1.5.0
> [B] Last feature caused the loop not to break if the user went bust,
      this is now fixed.

1.4.9
> [N] If the user gets 21 then they aren't offered another card, and
      the user automatically sticks.

1.4.8
> [B] Previously, if the player or the dealer's max score was over 21,
      both wouldn't be included in the score comparison. Now both max
	  scores are classed as "safe" seporately, this allows for more
	  cases; i.e. If the user's max score is greater than the dealer's
	  min score where the dealer's max score is "unsafe".

1.4.7
> [N] Now tells user how many games they won at the end of the game.

1.4.6
> [N] Counts how many games the user played, displays at end.
> [N] Once game is over, user is now given the option to play again.
> [N] User can now give up by sticking on their first turn.
> [N] Tidied layout up a little; spacing should now be perfect.

1.4.2
> [B] Quit game feature (q or e keys at any prompt) works again.
* [N] If special trick is achived, game ends instantly.
* [N] Current player can now achive a five card trick.
> [B] Dodgy was spelt wrong; thanks to Rebel for pointing this out.
> [N] Slight pause added if the user goes bust; just gives them some
      time to figure out what went on.

1.2.3
> [N] If user goes bust then sticks, dealer dosen't take his turn.
> [N] Chosen card is shown after the user twists.
